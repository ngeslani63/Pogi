                    <p>
                        The Philipine Organization of Golfing Individuals (POGI) was formed in 2001,
                        by several friends who had a common cause in life. They wanted to form a group
                        where they could get together, develop good relationships with each other and progress through life.
                        Fortunately, we all fell in love with golf and the rest is POGI history.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The common characteristic among us is we left our homeland with a great
                        desire to succeed in life. It was a necessity for our families.
                        We had our education and must undertake the challenge of raising our families here in the USA.
                        We needed to support each other in the sharing of ideas, with humor, care and respect.
                        We started buying our houses, raising children, taking care of sick relatives and helping others.
                        Approximately 2 decades later, the POGI is a shining example of success.
                        POGI players feel a deep bond with each other, our families get along and we are beginning to
                        See second generation POGI children get involved.
                    <p>

                        The league is well run and we have important rules that govern us. Members
                        are willing to participate in the functioning of the league. Our tournaments
                        are fair and well executed.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="text-secondary">Swing for Tech</h4>
                    <p>
                        We are undertaking a big investment in our future by upgrading
                        The technology stack behind our website. Fortunately, we have
                        members who can undertake this complex endeavor. We will have the latest cloud
                        technology, mobile application software stack and modern design concepts.
                        That will allow the application to evolve over time. The prior website did
                        its job in getting  us this far but it is time to upgrade.

                    <p>
                        To all my POGI friends,

                        Welcome to 2018 golf season! It is my honor and privilege to preside the 2018 and 2019 POGI League seasons. With the support of  all the Executive Board and Core members, we will continue the tradition of POGI to promote camaraderie among us and continue to enjoy every round of golf that awaits us for this season. We will continue our competitive major tournaments and of course mini/money tour will not go away but it will be bigger. There will be new POGI rules and would be fair to everyone.

                        I look forward to playing with all of you and I shall say, let the fun begin.

                    <p>Dear POGI members,</p>
                    <p>
                        For the past two years, it has been a privilege and an honor to serve you as POGI President. I have good reason to express my heartfelt thanks to most of you but especially to the executive committee officers.  We have accomplished much together in these years that passed too quickly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Together, we’ve successfully ran tournaments and incorporated changes that put more excitement to the game such as cash awards in addition to trophies. We’ve expanded mini tournaments and combined its championship with one of our major events. We’ve recruited new members and have seen former members come back. We’ve introduced new event format, scramble, and were able to get a full sponsorship from a major company.  And more importantly, we were able to have fun playing golf! That was the main goal, we are all passionate about this game and POGI is a great platform for us to test our skills, enjoy the competition and each other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I move from President to Past President this year, I assure you this is not farewell. I hope to continue giving to the organization, and I encourage all of our members that as we enjoy and benefit from this organization, consider giving back. How can YOU improve our group? Anything we can do better? Be part of the solution. I thank you all from the bottom of my heart for allowing me to lead this organization for the last two years. I wish everyone a great 2018 season and I look forward to the wonderful things in store for our organization!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Joey Alfonso<br />
